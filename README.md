### Learning Objectives

- Building dynamic links
- useRouteMatch custom hook

### Description

React is great at building single page applications AKA SPAs. A single page applications uses only one .html file to make up the entire application and React handles switching out different views based on the URL. React doesn’t have a built in Router so we use the react-router-dom library to give React this ability to switch out components. React router dom provides use with multiple custom hooks including useParams, useHistory, and useLocation to help manage our state. It also gives us multiple components like Switch, BrowserRouter and Route, and Link to navigate around our application

For this project you will be creating a list/detail view for data retrieved from an api of your choice. You’ll be using React Router to navigate to a detail page that shows specific information about the selected item.
